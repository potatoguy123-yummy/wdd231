        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>What is "ew"? What is this server for?</h2>
            <p>"ew" is a private server, written in Rust, for the short lived game "Love Live! School idol festival 2 MIRACLE LIVE!", a Love Live! themed mobile rhythm game.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>I'm just trying to play on this server, how do I install the app? (Android)</h2>
            <p id="downloadUrl">Your server admin has no pre-patched apks to download. See the question below..</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>My server admin has no download URLs, how do I patch the apk? (Android)</h2>
            <p>You can use <a href="https://arasfon.ru/sif2/patcher/">@arasfon's sif2 apk patcher</a>. Plug and the asset url, which is "<span class="assetUrl">https://sif2.sif.moe</span>", into the "Assets URL" textbox, and then the server url (Which is likely "<span class="windowlocation"></span>", though this may not be the case). Select your game version, set "header format" to "Lowercase", and press patch. Once that done, use <a href="https://github.com/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer">uber-apk-signer</a> to sign the apk. Then, get it onto your phone and install!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>How do I install the app? (iOS)</h2>
            <p>Running on iOS is much simpler than Android, thanks to triangle on the discord. You first download an ipa file for <a id="downloadUrliOSGL" src="https://ethanthesleepy.one/public/lovelive/sif2/sif2-gl.ipa">global</a> or <a id="downloadUrliOSJP" src="https://ethanthesleepy.one/public/lovelive/sif2/sif2-jp.ipa">Japan</a>, and use <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Sideloadly</a> (or your preferred application installer) to install the app. Then open settings, navigate to the app you just installed, and input the server url (Which is likely "<span class="windowlocation"></span>", though this may not be the case), and the asset url, which is "<span class="assetUrl">https://sif2.sif.moe</span>". If you have any errors opening the app, make sure none of the urls in settings end with a slash (/).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Help! I'm trying to open the app and it shows as "unavailable" (iOS)</h2>
            <p>Do not delete it, Just re-sideload the app. This is an Apple security feature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>How well does this work?</h2>
            <p>Works well enough. The server itself takes up not even 20mb of storage, and it's written in rust. I personally think it's pretty well written.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Could my computer/laptop run a server?</h2>
            <p>Very very likely. If the platform is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">supported by rust</a>, then the answer is yes! It is recommended to manually compile the project until I get the time to setup actions. <a href="https://git.ethanthesleepy.one/ethanaobrien/ew">ew repo</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Is the server down right now? I can't connect</h2>
            <p>Assuming you have just loaded this page on the server you use, then the answer is no, otherwise please contact your server admin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Do events work?</h2>
            <p>Most events do not, though most should not crash the game. Star events are partially implemented. You can get your rank up, and compete with other players in a ranking table, but no rewards are currently implemented.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>But then, how do I get event URs?</h2>
            <p>There are serial codes for several things, one of which includes all the event URs. I don't remember what does what but it is recommended to look at the serial code file to get the latest codes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Why does the game crash when I do x?</h2>
            <p>This likely means something on the server is broken. If you're self hosting, please contact me. Otherwise, contact your server admin and ask them to report the issue.</p>
